<!-- Explanation of "Homestead" -->
<div>
  <p id="homestead_explanation">
  Self-sustainability, ingenuity, and the spirit of carving out one's stake
  are the values that inspired homesteading long ago. H0M3ST3AD was created
  with these very same ideals in mind. This platform allows the user to build
  a "digital homestead," a fully-customizable platform to build a central
  automated and self-sustaining living space. This has been achieved to some
  degree using cloud servers and IoT solutions; however, H0M3ST3AD is more
  versatile in that it can be run on a home server, with full offline
  compatibility.
  <br><br>
  This is where "self-sustaining" truly comes into play. You
  are the master of your own domain and if you want to run an automated
  gardening system, then you should be able to do so independently. At the
  same time, this does not mean that the system must be run offline, as there
  are obvious advantages to having such a system connected to the internet.
  Again, the idea is that the way the system runs is completely in your hand.
  Should you want to access it via SSH, VPN, or even export it publically,
  then you have the power to do so.
  <br><br>
  H0M3ST3AD is an ongoing project and features will continue to be added.
  New tools will hopefully be made available on a regular basis to help create
  your ideal system. For now, however, welcome home.
